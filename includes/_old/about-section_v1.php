				<p>Music has been in my soul since I was a little girl. I needed to listen to music to get to sleep at night. And I did it for so many years that it just got into my cells and it became part of who I am. I grew up in San Francisco in the 60s and 70s when it was totally about music. I started sneaking out of the house and going to shows at the Fillmore and Winterland when I was about 13. I wrote music with a keyboard player at UC Berkeley and played with his band. It was the most exciting things I’d ever done in my life. I thought….can I DO this? And…I didn’t. Not then.</p>

				<p>In 2009, I had an epiphany, triggered by a dear friend. I knew I HAD to share the music inside me and set this rock and roll girl free! Playing music allows me to share with others what is in my heart and has changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>

				<p>I have been performing since 2009. I have had the great fortune to share the stage with some phenomenal musicians who have played with New Riders of the Purple Sage, Etta James, Art Blakey, and Supertramp, to name a few, along with many talented players in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have played with many different bands as leader, back-up singer, on the fly, or rehearsed. Collaborating with other musicians is enlivening and exciting, not to mention exceedingly enjoyable!</p>
				<p>I am drawn to Americana and Roots music, vintage country, Blues, and Country Rock… songs that are authentic and tell a story of people, places, and real experiences. When the band is in sync and we can make the music come alive through us, it’s a feeling like none other. Music raises the vibration of the planet. It’s an honor to connect with people in this way and make an audience happy.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Making music is a place where I feel free!</strong></p>
