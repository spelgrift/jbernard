				<p>Music has been in my soul since I was a little girl. I needed to listen to music to get to sleep at night. And I did it for so many years that it just got into my cells and became part of who I am. I grew up in San Francisco in the 60s and 70s - in my world, it was totally about music! Shows at the Fillmore, Winterland, free music in the park, singing and writing songs…the excitement was intoxicating!</p>

				<p>In 2009, I had an epiphany… I knew I HAD to share the music inside me and set this rock and roll girl free! Playing music allows me to share with others what is in my heart and has changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>

				<p>Since then, I have had the great fortune to play with some phenomenal musicians who have played with New Riders of the Purple Sage, Etta James, Art Blakey, and Supertramp, to name a few, along with other talented players in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have been a band leader, a back-up singer, sung on the fly, or rehearsed!</p>

				<p><em>Collaborating with other musicians is enlivening and exciting, not to mention exceedingly fun!</em></p>

				<p>I am drawn to Americana, roots music, vintage country, blues, and country rock… songs that are authentic and tell a story of people, places, and real experiences. When the band is in sync and we can make the music come alive through us, it’s a feeling like none other. Music raises the vibration of the planet. It’s an honor to connect with people in this way and make an audience happy.</p>
